          <p>
            I don’t stop at “good enough” but strive to have the best solution
            for the problem that’s set before me. I have a need to know how
            things work, and why they are the way they are. This drive is why,
            when I left the field, I started to deep dive in the world of my
            second passion of internal combustion and its associated systems. I
            love to learn new things, for example, over the last couple of years
            I have taught myself how to design and manufacture products with new
            software and G-code and then produce them on a hobbyist CNC machine.
            I’m also in the process of learning to code for the Arduino
            platform. I’ll use all the resources at my disposal to help me
            accomplish the goals I have associated with each of these platforms
            and will continue to do so, such as journals, articles, books,
            videos and any other media or information that are relevant.
